Automating the perfect Spotify playlist

This Spotify app will track your most listened to songs in the background. It will then use this data to create the perfect playlist based on your listening history. The playlist is originally created by the user and can have no more than 250 songs in it. As the user uses Spotify, they can add songs to the playlist. Once the playlist contains more than 250 songs, the app will automatically find the least listened to songs on the playlist and remove them.

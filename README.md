Automating the perfect Spotify playlist

This program will automatically removes the least listened to songs on one of your Spotify playlists. Once it is authorized on the user's account, it will keep track of what songs they listen to and use that data to ensure that their playlist is always fresh. Users can set how many songs they would like in their playlist. Everytime the user adds a song over that limit, the bot will instantly remove the least listened to song.
